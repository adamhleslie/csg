Final Progress Report

We have implemented the BSP tree and minimally tested our triangle placement and cutting algorithm.


The high level explanation:
Each primitive mesh (cylinder, sphere etc.) is built into a BSP tree.
Depending on the type of operation done on two different primitives, we merge the two BSP trees
and either discard or keep triangles within the newly merged BSP tree. When merged,
intersecting triangles are split into identical subtriangles, so we only keep surface
level geometry.

This also requires that we create our own language interpreter so that a user could define
inside a text file a way to generate this merged mesh out of primitives. This will include operations
like Union, Intersection and Difference.

What the plan is for completing the project on time:
We will continue to work in a pair as that has produced favorable results.
The next step is to create functions that will generate the primitive triangle geometry.
Then after that, create the merging of our primitive's BSP trees based on the specifications
of the language.
